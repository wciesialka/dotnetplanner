Planner in C# .NET

## Why?

I have little experience with C#. I use in infrequently with the Unity Engine, and the last time I built a desktop application with it was several years ago. Living in the midwest, where developers with C# is in high demand, I wanted to familiarize myself with it. I thought a good project may be a planner - something where you can add "events" to a "calendar" and may look at those events, mark them as completed, be reminded of them, or delete them.
